# Part 2: Intro to drawing with JavaScript 

We'll be working in pairs to tinker with more code, using functions provided by awesome [**p5js library**](https://p5js.org/) designed to making coding more accessible for beginners, especially for artists who want to make creative works with code.

<br/>

## How to use Glitch for our next challenges:

<br/>

:star: [**Click here to open a template project with p5js already set up**](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/canvas-challenges) :star:

<br/>

**Instructions:**

  1. Save your own personal copy of the template project by clicking the project's name in the top left corner, and then click "Remix This" in the dropdown menu to make your own personal copy.
  
  2. It will load the page again, and generate a name made of *two random words*. This is your own personal copy that nobody else can edit.
  
  3. **To see the live app and test it out**, click "Show Live" on the top left and it'll open the web page in another tab.

<br/>

## Challenge 1:

Copy the example code below and paste it ***right after*** the `createCanvas()` function that's being used on **line 10** in our JavaScript file.

```javascript
rect(200, 300, 50, 100);
```

Then try ***changing*** those four numbers that draw the rectangle, and ***identify*** what they all do!

  > Be sure to click **"Show Live"** at the top left of the page to open your live web page and see your amazing rectangle!

<br/>

## Challenge 2

Take a closer look at the `createCanvas()` function that we're using on line 10. ***Change*** the two numbers and ***identify*** what they both do.

Again, remember to check the live web page each time you change the numbers to see what happens!


<br/>

## Challenge 3:

Draw a circles using the `ellipse()` function -- see [the p5js reference page for ellipses](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse) and feel free to copy code examples from there!

<br/>

## Challenge 4:

Let's do this challenge in a few separate steps:

  1. Before anything else, put your heads together and discuss what you know so far about the coordinate system we've been using with drawing these shapes.
  
  2. Take a guess as to what the coordinates are for the ***top left corner*** of the canvas. For each of your guesses, discuss **why*** you think that might be the case.
  
  3. Finally, ***change*** your code so that your circle will appear in the top left corner of the page.
  
  4. Did it work? Why or why not? (And did you learn something from this experiment?)

<br/>

## Challenge 5:

Draw a second circle and place it ***exactly in the center of the canvas***.

  > **Hint:** You'll need to take a look at the numbers used with our `createCanvas()` function on line 10, and do a little bit of mental arithmetic to find the coordinates for the halfway point

<br/>

## Challenge 6:

Look at [the reference page for the `fill()` function](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/fill) and use it to draw ***two*** separate shapes, using ***different colors*** for each one.

  > **Remember:** the goal here is to experiment and give yourself permission to *learn by doing* -- and by *failing!* *Over and over again!*

<br/>

## Challenge 7:

First, ***take a guess*** as to what will happen when we run the example code below. ***Discuss*** your ideas!

After you've made predictions and discussed them, copy-paste the code somewhere immediately after your previous lines of code, and see what happens:

```javascript
let squareWidth = 75;
rect(400, 350, squareWidth, squareWidth);
```

<br/>

## Challenge 8:

Write two more lines of code to create two more variables, one for each coordinate that determines where the square will be drawn on the canvas. Assign a number between 0 and 500 to each of your two variables, mirroring the example:

```javascript
let squareWidth = 75;
// Write two more lines of code below to create the variables for xPos and yPos


rect(xPos, yPos, squareWidth, squareWidth);
```

We'll take our simple shapes and start moving them across the screen, our first intro to animating with code!
