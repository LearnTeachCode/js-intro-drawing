# Part 2: Intros with a group coding icebreaker

We'll be working in pairs to tinker with more code, using functions provided by awesome [**p5js library**](https://p5js.org/) designed to making coding more accessible for beginners, especially for artists who want to make creative works with code.

:books: **To learn more about p5js:**

  - [Official p5js "Getting Started" guide](https://p5js.org/get-started/)
  - [Full reference manual](https://p5js.org/reference/) about all the p5js functions

## How to use Glitch for our next challenges:

:star: [**Click here to open a template project with p5js already set up**](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/canvas-challenges) :star:

**Instructions:**

  1. Save your own personal copy of the template project by clicking the project's name in the top left corner, and then click "Remix This" in the dropdown menu to make your own personal copy.
  
  2. It will load the page again, and generate a name made of *two random words*. This is your own personal copy that nobody else can edit.
  
  3. **To see the live app and test it out**, click "Show Live" on the top left and it'll open the web page in another tab.
